# WD-302-No-pollution-is-the-only-solution
This is an advocacy project with the title “No pollution is the only solution”
\

Final project requirement in Advanced Dynamic Web Applications Second Semester A.Y. 2021-2022

==================================================

BACKGROUND:
Environmentalism is a philosophy that focuses on the need for humanity to respect, protect, and preserve the natural world from manmade/human-caused diseases. Environmental awareness is the key to the movement's success. By informing our family and friends about how fragile and important the physical environment is, we may begin to address problems that harm the environment. For decades, environmentalists have advised the public to recycle, reduce, and reuse and that advice is still valid today. Small daily actions can still help promote a more sustainable and biocentric worldview, even if systemic change is required to shift our current direction. When thought and action are combined, they can make a significant difference. Our group has decided to stand and advocate "no pollution is the only option" and that reducing pollution one step at a time will help solve bigger environmental problems.
